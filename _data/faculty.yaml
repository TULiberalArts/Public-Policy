    Professor Hosea H. Harvey’s research interests center around using empirical methods to solve a central question: what is the appropriate role of the law in minimizing the effects of race and gender disparities in business organizations, consumer markets, and regulatory policies?  Professor Harvey’s future publications challenge the empirical basis for recent consumer finance law reforms, arguing that such reforms run counter to consumer behavior and have race and gender stratified consequences.   Most recently, two of Professor Harvey’s articles question the empirical basis and potential effectiveness of state-level public health interventions in youth sports.  Previous work has included examinations of the political psychology of race and politics in the United States, as well as an extensive examination of antitrust harms for racial minorities in film and sports product markets. Prior to joining the Temple faculty, Professor Harvey served as General Counsel for New York Needs You, a start-up non-profit focused on mentoring, cultivating leadership, and enhancing career opportunities for low-income first-generation New York area college students.
