The Master of Public Policy (MPP) 4 Plus 1 program allows promising undergraduate students to complete their undergraduate and MPP degrees in five years instead of the usual six years that it takes to complete both degrees separately. Follow this link to learn more information about the [MPP degree](/public-policy/mpp-degree/).

## How it Works

The MPP curriculum consists of a total of 36 credits. Students may enter the 4 Plus 1 program as juniors or seniors. Those who enter as juniors take four 3-credit courses (12 credits total) while they are undergraduates and take the remaining 24 credits as full-time MPP students in the summer following graduation and the Plus 1 year. The 12 MPP credits that students take towards the MPP degree as undergraduates count as credit for both their Bachelorâ€™s and MPP degrees. Those who enter the 4 Plus 1 program as seniors take three 3-credit courses (9 credits total) while they are seniors. Students take the remaining 27 credits after they earn their undergraduate degrees as full-time MPP students during the summer following graduation and the Plus 1 year.

## Program Location 

Students take all of the required MPP courses and select electives at the Center City campus. 

## Application Requirements and Procedures for Admissions

To enter the program as a junior, apply once you reach 45 or more credits towards your undergraduate degree and up to the start of your junior year. Take one MPP course in each of the last four semesters of your careers as undergraduate students.  To enter the program as a senior, you should apply once you reach 75 or more credits towards your undergraduate degree and up to the start of your senior year.
