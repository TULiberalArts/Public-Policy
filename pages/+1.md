## Earn Your Undergraduate and MPP Degree in Five Years
![Four Plus One Public Policy Degree Program]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mpp-accelerated-degree-program-temple.png){:.img-right}
The Master of Public Policy (MPP) Four Plus One program allows promising students to complete both an undergraduate and MPP degree in five years. Normally, completing each degree separately takes six years. You can apply for the accelerated degree program as a junior or senior. If you are admitted as a junior, you will take four 3-credit courses (12 credits total) as an undergraduate and take the remaining 24 credits as a full-time MPP student in the summer following graduation and during your Plus 1 year. If you enter the 4 + 1 program as a senior, you will take three 3-credit courses (9 credits total) in your final year as an undergraduate and the remaining 27 credits after as a full-time MPP student during the summer following graduation and your Plus 1 year. 

As an added bonus, the MPP credits you take as an undergraduate count toward both your graduate and bachelor's degree.  All required MPP courses and select electives are held at the Center City campus in the evenings.

## Capital Semester in Harrisburg or Washington DC
The [Washington Semester](http://www.cla.temple.edu/ipa/the-washington-semester/) and the [Pennsylvania Capital Semester](http://www.cla.temple.edu/ipa/about/the-pennsylvania-capital-semester/) provides you an opportunity to gain valuable career experience in the nation's capital, while remaining a full-time student. If you are accepted into the 4 Plus 1 accelerated degree program, your MPP internship requirement is fulfilled by your semester or summer in Washington/Harrisburg by registering for PLCY 5085. In addition, if you participate in the Capital Semester program, you must make up the required MPP course you would take at Temple during your Plus 1 year. 

## Application Requirements
You may apply to the program as a junior after you've earned 45 credits toward your bachelor's degree. If you are accepted, you will take an MPP course each of the remaining four semesters as an undergraduate. If you want to enter the program as a senior, apply once you have earned 75 credits or more toward your bachelor's degree. Seniors admitted to the program take three MPP courses in the final two semesters as undergraduates (see attached course schedule in pdf). As a successful applicant, you are officially admitted to the MPP program effective in the Summer session after you graduate with your bachelor's degree. You are not required to take the GRE exam or to take any particular courses or course of study as perquisites for admission. 

**Our eligibility requirements are listed below.**

- Undergraduate GPA of at least 3.5 in all courses
- Resume
- Personal statement that addresses your goals in the 4 + 1 program, followed by a meeting with the MPP Director to discuss your suitability.

- Approval to enter the program from the Director of the MPP program
- Proof that you are able to devote 9 credits as “free electives” if you are admitted as a senior (or 12 credits if you enter as juniors) outside of your undergraduate major or you are permitted to count specific MPP courses towards your major requirements, or some combination (PLCY 8118 and POLS 8001 qualify for the BA and MPP for Political Science majors; ECON 8122 qualifies for Economics majors).
