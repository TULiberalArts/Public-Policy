### Institute for Public Affairs
Temple University’s [Institute for Public Affairs](http://www.cla.temple.edu/ipa/) conducts, supports and disseminates interdisciplinary research to inform and improve public policy, focusing particularly on Philadelphia, the greater metropolitan area and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Temple's Public Policy faculty and the Institute for Public Affairs conduct research relevant to addressing social and quality of life issues throughout the Commonwealth and the Philadelphia region. Recent research includes:

- Quantifying the economic costs of underachieving public schools
- Measuring effectiveness of child care subsidies in helping parents stay in the workforce
- Identifying ways to better manage the water supply and other common pool resources
- Evaluating how different approaches to policing contribute to public safety
- Exploring steps to improve regional cooperation in addressing a wide range of public policy issues in Southeastern Pennsylvania
- Examining ways to improve public health
- Identifying options to reform and fund state and local public pensions
- Proposing legislative steps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Pennsylvania’s fragmented system of municipal governments
- Cataloguing and evaluating potential changes in the structure and operations of the Pennsylvania General Assembly

### University Community Collaborative
The [University Community Collaborative](http://uccollab.org/) (UCC) prepares and supports young people to become confident, effective leaders through youth programming. Engaging approximately 130 youth per year (ages 14-24), our programming is distinguished by its emphasis on long term development, its incorporation of youth leaders into the Collaborative’s organizational structure, its social justice/community building orientation and its location on a university campus. 
This combination has created a large cadre of high school and college students who have followed the civic pathway to college and the college pathway to civic leadership.
