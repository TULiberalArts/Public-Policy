## Earn an MPP at Temple University
![MPP Degree Program at Temple University]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mpp-degree-temple.jpg){:.img-right}
The Master of Public Policy program offers an affordable education just steps from Philadelphia's City Hall at [Temple's Center City Campus](https://www.temple.edu/tucc/){:target=“_blank”} in the evening. Whether you are a recent college graduate or you've already started a career, the MPP program combines a robust research environment and real-world experience to help students learn the technical and analytic skills needed for successful careers in non-profit organizations, or in the private or public sector. Learn to assess, develop and evaluate the effectiveness of programs and activities of governments at the federal, local and state levels.

Careers aren’t shaped solely in classrooms. Students apply what they learn in class to internships or to the jobs that many already have in public service. The MPP program also sponsors a variety of extracurricular events including candidate forums, guest speakers, panels of experts on policy issues and public service careers workshops.

Please visit the [Public Policy Graduate Admissions page](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/admissions/graduate/public-policy) to learn more about graduate program requirements, dates and deadlines and instructions on how to apply.

## Faculty with Real-World Experience
Our dynamic faculty bring years of academic and real-world experience and expertise to their teaching as agency heads and supervisors, budget and finance managers, consultants, leaders of non-profit organizations, policymakers and senior policy advisors. They conduct research relevant into social and quality of life issues throughout the Commonwealth and the Philadelphia region. You can focus on either public management or public policy analysis.

## The MPP Curriculum

The 36 credit MPP curriculum consists of 8 required courses, an internship and 3 electives. Full-time students are able to complete the program in two years. If you enroll part-time, the program takes between three and five years. You will gain practical experience in public and nonprofit sector organizations and work on real-world projects and programs designed to address public problem policies.

## Admission Requirements
Successful applicants to the MPP program have a minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.0. If your GPA exceeds 3.3 or you have several years of relevant career experience working with governmental agencies, it is possible to waive the GRE exam requirement. Unless you specifically ask us for a GRE waiver, we will assume that you intend to send us GRE scores, and wait for them before we review your application. If you wish to inquire about your competitiveness for admission or whether you are eligible for a GRE waiver, send your resume and unofficial transcripts to [mpp@temple.edu](mailto:mpp@temple.edu).

Please visit the [Public Policy Graduate Admissions page](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/admissions/graduate/public-policy) to learn more about graduate program requirements, dates and deadlines and instructions on how to apply.

## New MPP-MPH Dual Degree Program
We now offer a dual degree program that allows graduate students to earn both an Master of Public Policy and a Master of Public Health (MPP-MPH). Federal, state and local governments play a large and growing role in public health by combatting epidemics, funding research into public health problems and programs, issuing regulations, providing critical resources aimed at public education and training the public health workforce. Adding the MPP to the MPH will enhance your qualifications for jobs at the intersection of public policy and public health. Complete both degrees in 3 years by earning 57 credits.

## Academic Support and Advising
![Photo of Pat]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resize Pat Borsuk.jpg){:.img-right} 
As a student working toward your MPP, you will receive support and guidance from our program and Temple University. All of our instructors are personable, helpful folks and are happy to work with students on an individual basis. If you have general questions about how to register for classes, find academic buildings, or the like, you can also ask [Jeff Antsen](mailto:Jeff.Antsen@temple.edu), the Assistant Director.

## Temple Graduate School Funding
Like most other Master’s degree programs, we generally do not have scholarships or other assistantships for MPP students. However, the cost of our program is very competitive when compared to that of other similar degrees in the region, particularly if you are eligible for in-state tuition. Some employers subsidize their employees’ educational expenses. Otherwise, most students finance their own educations or borrow from the regular financial aid programs. Explore all available funding and apply early to make your education an affordable experience.

## Tuition and Fees
For more than 130 years, we have focused on providing a world-class education at an affordable price. Just compare Temple to other universities and see what we mean. Temple tuition rates vary by college or school, residency status, student level and more. Use the [Temple Tuition Calculator](https://bursar.temple.edu/tuition-and-fees/tuition-rates) to estimate your tuition rate.

## Transferring Credits from other MPP or MPA Programs into Temple
Students admitted to the MPP program can transfer up to 6 credits. The credits must have been earned at a reputable institution with a grade of B or better and Temple must have equivalent courses in its course inventory. Students who wish to transfer credits need to submit a transcript listing the courses to be transferred and set up an appointment with the MPP Director to discuss transferring into the program. Transfer students must apply to the MPP program and generally meet the same requirements as other applicants, although their performance in another MPP or MPA program will be given special consideration in the admissions decision. Questions about whether applicants qualify for waivers should be sent to [mpp@temple.edu](mailto:mpp@temple.edu). For more admission requirements, review the [Graduate Bulletin](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/public-policy-mpp/#admissiontext){:target=“_blank”}.
