## Earn an MPP at Temple University
![MPP Degree Program at Temple University]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mpp-degree-temple.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
The Master of Public Policy program offers an affordable education just steps from Philadelphia's City Hall at [Temple's Center City Campus](https://www.temple.edu/tucc/){:target=“_blank”} in the evening. Whether you are a recent college graduate or you've already started a career, the MPP program combines a robust research environment and real-world experience to help students learn the technical and analytic skills needed for successful careers in non-profit organizations, or in the private or public sector. Learn to assess, develop and evaluate the effectiveness of programs and activities of governments at the federal, local and state levels.

Careers aren’t shaped solely in classrooms. Students apply what they learn in class to internships or to the jobs that many already have in public service. The MPP program also sponsors a variety of extracurricular events including candidate forums, guest speakers, panels of experts on policy issues and public service careers workshops.

## The MPP Curriculum

The 36 credit MPP curriculum consists of 8 required courses, an internship and 3 electives. Full-time students are able to complete the program in two years and in as little as a year and a half if they enter in the fall semester and take courses in the summer. If you enroll part-time, the program takes between three and five years. Our schedule of evening classes make it possible for our students to work during the daytime. You will gain practical experience in public and nonprofit sector organizations and work on real-world projects and programs designed to address public policy problems.

## New MPP-MPH Dual Degree Program
We offer a dual degree program that allows graduate students to earn both a Master of Public Policy and a Master of Public Health (MPP-MPH). Federal, state and local governments play a large and growing role in public health by combatting epidemics, funding research into public health problems and programs, issuing regulations, providing critical resources aimed at public education and training the public health workforce. Adding the MPP to the MPH will enhance your qualifications for jobs at the intersection of public policy and public health. MPP-MPH dual degree students are able to graduate in 3 years by earning 57 credits.

## Academic Support and Advising
![Photo of Pat]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resize Pat Borsuk.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
As a student working toward your MPP, you will receive support and guidance from our program and Temple University. The support and guidance includes a focus on employment readiness, working with the Temple Career Center and assisting with internship and permanent job search activities. Here is a [brief summary](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/sites/liberalarts/files/MPP%20Resources%20External%20Version.pdf) of the ways we promote professional development with our students. All of our instructors are personable, helpful folks and are happy to work with students on an individual basis. If you have general questions about how to register for classes, find academic buildings, or the like, you can also ask the [Assistant Director](mailto:mpp@temple.edu).

## Temple Graduate School Funding
The cost of our program is very competitive when compared to that of other similar degrees in the region, particularly if you are eligible for in-state tuition. Some employers subsidize their employees’ educational expenses. Otherwise, most students finance their own educations or borrow from the regular financial aid programs. Explore all available funding and apply early to make your education an affordable experience.

### MPP Funding
We award a limited number of partial scholarships on a competitive basis. Applicants who wish to be considered for an award should have an undergraduate GPA of 3.5 or higher and should apply by March 1st to assure consideration.

## Tuition and Fees
For more than 130 years, we have focused on providing a world-class education at an affordable price. Just compare Temple to other universities and see what we mean. Temple tuition rates vary by college or school, residency status, student level and more. Use the [Temple Tuition Calculator](https://bursar.temple.edu/tuition-and-fees/tuition-rates) to estimate your tuition rate.

## Transferring Credits from other MPP or MPA Programs into Temple
Students admitted to the MPP program can transfer up to 6 credits. The credits must have been earned at a reputable institution with a grade of B or better and Temple must have equivalent courses in its course inventory. Students who wish to transfer credits need to submit a transcript listing the courses to be transferred and set up an appointment with the MPP Director to discuss transferring into the program. Transfer students must apply to the MPP program and generally meet the same requirements as other applicants, although their performance in another MPP or MPA program will be given special consideration in the admissions decision. Questions about whether applicants qualify for waivers should be sent to [mpp@temple.edu](mailto:mpp@temple.edu).
