## Program Overview

Our MPP offers recent college graduates and those who have already started careers an affordable education just steps from Philadelphia’s City Hall with state-of-the-art instructional technology.

Temple’s faculty has a wealth of knowledge and experience that they are eager to share with students. Our professors conduct research relevant to addressing a wide variety of social issues and improving the quality of life throughout the Commonwealth and the Philadelphia region. Recent research includes:

- quantifying the economic costs of underachieving public schools;
– measuring effectiveness of child care subsidies in helping parents stay in the workforce;
– identifying ways to better manage the water supply and other common pool resources;
– evaluating how different approaches to policing contribute to public safety;
– exploring steps to improve regional cooperation in addressing a wide range of public policy issues in Southeastern Pennsylvania;
– examining ways to improve public health;
– identifying options to reform and fund state and local public pensions;
– proposing legislative steps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Pennsylvania’s fragmented system of municipal governments; and
– cataloguing and evaluating potential changes in the structure and operations of the Pennsylvania General Assembly
