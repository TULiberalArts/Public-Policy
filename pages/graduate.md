Our program uses state-of-the-art instructional technology in classrooms just steps from Philadelphia's City Hall.

Read on for information about our [master of public policy](#program-overview) and our [+1 program](#announcements).

## Program Overview

Our [Master of Public Policy](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/public-policy-mpp/) (MPP) is designed for both recent college graduates and those who have already started careers.

Temple’s faculty has a wealth of knowledge and experience that they are eager to share with students. Our professors conduct research relevant to addressing a wide variety of social issues and improving the quality of life throughout the commonwealth and the Philadelphia region. Recent research includes the following:

- quantifying the economic costs of underachieving public schools
- measuring effectiveness of child care subsidies in helping parents stay in the workforce
- identifying ways to better manage the water supply and other common pool resources
- evaluating how different approaches to policing contribute to public safety
- exploring steps to improve regional cooperation in addressing a wide range of public policy issues in Southeastern Pennsylvania
- examining ways to improve public health
- identifying options to reform and fund state and local public pensions
- proposing legislative steps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Pennsylvania’s fragmented system of municipal governments
- cataloguing and evaluating potential changes in the structure and operations of the Pennsylvania General Assembly
