## Earn an Master of Public Policy at Temple University
Temple University’s Master of Public Policy (MPP) trains students and practitioners for successful careers in the public sector or in private or non-profit organizations. Whether you are a recent college graduate or you've already started a career, we offer an affordable education at a convenient location – just steps from Philadelphia’s City Hall. Learn the technical and analytic skills to be able to develop and assess proposed public policies and evaluate the effectiveness of programs and activities of governments at the federal, state and local levels. Classes are held at [Temple's Center City Campus](https://www.temple.edu/tucc/) (TUCC) on weekday evenings, conveniently located steps away from a major transportation hub (Suburban Station). The MPP is available on a part-time or full-time basis.

## A Program with Influence
Members of our faculty bring to their teaching years of academic and real-world experience and expertise as agency heads and supervisors, budget and finance managers, consultants, leaders of non-profit organizations, policymakers and senior policy advisors. Our professors conduct research relevant to addressing a wide variety of social issues and improving the quality of life throughout the Commonwealth and the Philadelphia region. You can focus on either public policy analysis or public management.

## New MPP-MPH Dual Degree Program
We now offer a dual degree program that allows graduate students to earn both an Master of Public Policy and a Master of Public Health (MPP-MPH). Federal, state and local governments play a large and growing role in Public Health by issuing regulations, providing critical resources aimed at public education, monitoring and combating epidemics, training the public health workforce and funding research into public health problems and programs. Adding the MPP to the MPH will enhance your qualifications for jobs that lie at the intersection of public policy and public health. Temple's MPH program at the [College of Public Health](https://cph.temple.edu/) is one of the longest established accredited program in community health in the country. Complete both degrees in 3 years by earning 57 credits.

## The Curriculum
The MPP 36 credit curriculum consists of 9 required courses, an internship and 3 electives. Full-time students will be able to complete the program in two years. If you enroll part-time, the program takes between three and five years. You will gain practical experience in public and nonprofit sector organizations and work on on real-world projects and programs designed to address public problem policies.
