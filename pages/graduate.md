## Earn an Master of Public Policy at Temple University
Whether you are a recent college graduate hoping to land an entry-level position in a government, private or non-profit organization or you already have experience and want training and credentials to further your career, the Master of Public Policy program is an affordable education just steps from Philadelphia's City Hall. Our courses provide the technical and analytical training to develop, assess and evaluate the effectiveness of programs and activities at the federal, state and local levels. Classes are held at [Temple's Center City Campus](https://www.temple.edu/tucc/) (TUCC) on weekday evenings, conveniently located steps away from a major transportation hub (Suburban Station). 

MPP students learn from full-time academics and experts with extensive real-world experience as policymakers, agency heads and supervisors, budget and finance managers, senior advisors to govenors and leaders in non-profits and business. Students have the opportunity to gain expertise in particular policy fields through elective courses but also develop generalist skills that are useful in whatever direction their interests take them over the course of their careers.

## Internships

## Funding for Graduate School
At Temple, we believe that students from all walks of life should have access to an outstanding college education. If you need help paying for graduate school, you aren’t alone. Most students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. Graduate students are eligible for financial assistance from federal, state, private and university sources. Explore all available funding and apply early to make your college education an affordable experience.

Financial aid is awarded on PhD students on academic merit. The department nominates our strongest candidates for Graduate School Fellowships, and offers a limited amount of TA-ships. Students from underrepresented groups may also be nominated for Future Faculty Fellowships. Due to limited resources, the department is not able to provide funding to all students, although the majority receive some funding eventually. MA students are not eligible for financial aid from the department.
