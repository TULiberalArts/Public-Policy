## Earn an Master of Public Policy at Temple University
Temple University’s Master of Public Policy (MPP) trains students and practitioners for successful careers in the public sector or in private or non-profit organizations. Whether you are a recent college graduate or you've already started a career, we offer an affordable education at a convenient location – just steps from Philadelphia’s City Hall. Learn the technical and analytic skills to be able to develop and assess proposed public policies and evaluate the effectiveness of programs and activities of governments at the federal, state and local levels. Classes are held at [Temple's Center City Campus](https://www.temple.edu/tucc/) (TUCC) on weekday evenings, conveniently located steps away from a major transportation hub (Suburban Station). The MPP is available on a part-time or full-time basis. 

## A Program with Influence
Members of our faculty bring to their teaching years of academic and real-world experience and expertise as agency heads and supervisors, budget and finance managers, consultants, leaders of non-profit organizations, policymakers and senior policy advisors. Our professors conduct research relevant to addressing a wide variety of social issues and improving the quality of life throughout the Commonwealth and the Philadelphia region. You can focus on either public policy analysis or public management.

## New MPP-MPH Dual Degree Program
We now offer a dual degree program that allows graduate students to earn both an Master of Public Policy and a Master of Public Health (MPP-MPH). Federal, state and local governments play a large and growing role in Public Health by issuing regulations, providing critical resources aimed at public education, monitoring and combating epidemics, training the public health workforce and funding research into public health problems and programs. Adding the MPP to the MPH will enhance your qualifications for jobs that lie at the intersection of public policy and public health. Temple's MPH program at the [College of Public Health](https://cph.temple.edu/) is one of the longest established accredited program in community health in the country. Complete both degrees in 3 years by earning 57 credits.

### Applications
Applications for the Spring 2018 and Fall 2018 MPP cohorts are now open! New applications will be accepted until November 1st, 2017 for Spring 2018, and until March 1st for Fall 2018.  Please have all supplementary application materials e-mailed to us (including letters of reference) at [mpp@temple.edu](mailto:mpp@temple.edu).

## Funding for Graduate School
At Temple, we believe that students from all walks of life should have access to an outstanding college education. If you need help paying for graduate school, you aren’t alone. Most students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. Graduate students are eligible for financial assistance from federal, state, private and university sources. Explore all available funding and apply early to make your college education an affordable experience.

Financial aid is awarded on PhD students on academic merit. The department nominates our strongest candidates for Graduate School Fellowships, and offers a limited amount of TA-ships. Students from underrepresented groups may also be nominated for Future Faculty Fellowships. Due to limited resources, the department is not able to provide funding to all students, although the majority receive some funding eventually. MA students are not eligible for financial aid from the department.
