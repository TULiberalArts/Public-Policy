## Program Overview

Our [Master of Public Policy](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/public-policy-mpp/) (MPP) offers recent college graduates and those who have already started careers an affordable education just steps from Philadelphia’s City Hall with state-of-the-art instructional technology.

Temple’s faculty has a wealth of knowledge and experience that they are eager to share with students.

- examining ways to improve public health

## The Curriculum

The MPP curriculum provides students with the technical and analytic skills to be able to develop and assess proposed public policies and evaluate the effectiveness of programs and activities that governments at the federal, state and local levels undertake. An MPP develops students’ appreciation for the political and institutional contexts in which issues reach the policy agenda and policies are formulated, adopted, implemented and evaluated.  The MPP’s internship and policy analysis project components allow students to gain practical experience in public and nonprofit sector organizations and work on real-world projects and programs designed to address public policy problems.  Students have the opportunity to gain expertise in particular policy fields through elective courses but also develop generalist skills that are useful in whatever direction their interests take them over the course of their careers.

The curriculum consists of nine required courses (27 credits), including an internship, and three 3-credit electives, for a total of 36 credits. Full-time students will be able to complete the program in two years. Students may also complete the degree as part-time.
