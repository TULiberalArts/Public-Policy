  Our Master of Public Policy (MPP) program trains students and practitioners who seek successful careers in the public sector or in private or nonprofit organizations that work on a continuous basis with government agencies, in a program that’s just steps away from Philadelphia City Hall.

## Become an Agent for Change
Advance your career. Enhance your community. Develop the analytic skills to be able to formulate and assess public policies and evaluate the effectiveness of government programs at the federal, state, and local levels. Learn the “softer” skills of leadership and communicating your ideas in a political context. 

We train generalists who combine technical competency with a sophisticated understanding of the policy process. Temple University’s public policy graduate degree is led by full-time faculty and working practitioners and is ideal for anyone interested in social and quality-of-life issues throughout Philadelphia and beyond.
