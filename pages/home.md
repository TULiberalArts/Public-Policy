## Become an Agent for Change
Advance your career. Enhance your community. Develop the analytic skills to be able to formulate and assess public policies and evaluate the effectiveness of government programs at the federal, state, and local levels. Learn the “softer” skills of leadership and communicating your ideas in a political context. We train generalists who combine technical competency with a sophisticated understanding of the policy process. If you are interested in social and quality of life issues throughout Philadelphia and beyond, Temple offers a graduate program in public policy led by full-time faculty and working practitioners.

## Real World Insight from Experts
Members of our faculty bring to their teaching years of academic and real-world experience and expertise as agency heads and supervisors, budget and finance managers, consultants, leaders of non-profit organizations, policymakers and senior policy advisors. We are affiliated with the [Institute for Public Affairs](http://www.cla.temple.edu/ipa/), a research institute that conducts, supports and disseminates interdisciplinary research to inform and improve public policy, focusing particularly on Philadelphia, the greater metropolitan area, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
