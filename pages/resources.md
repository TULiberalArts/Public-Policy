## Temple Faculty and Connections

Members of our faculty bring to their teaching years of real-world experience and expertise as policymakers, agency heads and supervisors, budget and finance managers, senior advisors to governors, mayors, and legislatures, leaders of business and non-profit organizations, and consultants.

Many Temple graduates already hold important posts in state and local government, in nonprofits and consulting firms.  Our alumni include many elected officials, state and local legislators and judges and their staffs, as well as appointed public officials, non-profit leaders, and consultants who work in budgeting and finance, social services, public health, public education, environmental protection, economic development, public safety, and a wide range of other policy fields. They provide important networks through which our graduates will gain entrée into exciting and rewarding careers.  This new program is specifically designed to provide education and training for students who seek to follow similar career paths in the future.

## The Curriculum

The MPP curriculum provides students with the technical and analytic skills to be able to develop and assess proposed public policies and evaluate the effectiveness of programs and activities that governments at the federal, state and local levels undertake. An MPP develops students’ appreciation for the political and institutional contexts in which issues reach the policy agenda and policies are formulated, adopted, implemented and evaluated.  The MPP’s internship and policy analysis project components allow students to gain practical experience in public and nonprofit sector organizations and work on real-world projects and programs designed to address public policy problems.  Students have the opportunity to gain expertise in particular policy fields through elective courses but also develop generalist skills that are useful in whatever direction their interests take them over the course of their careers.
The curriculum consists of nine required courses (27 credits), including an internship, and three 3-credit electives, for a total of 36 credits. Full-time students will be able to complete the program in two years.  Students may also complete the degree as part-time.
