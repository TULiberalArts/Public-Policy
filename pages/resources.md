## Frequently Asked Questions
This guide gives answers to many of the questions which we receive most frequently about Temple’s MPP program that we do not address elsewhere on our website.  If you are looking for answers to questions which aren’t included here, feel free to reach out to us at [MPP@temple.edu](mailto:MPP@temple.edu), and we’ll get back to you as quickly as possible

**Q:  Do you offer MPP courses during the summer or on Saturdays?**
At this time, a limited number of elective courses are offered in the summer. As the program grows, we anticipate that more elective and required courses will be offered in the summer. We may offer Saturday courses in the future if sufficient numbers of students indicate that they would enroll. 

**Q: When do Temple’s academic terms begin and end?**
Fall semesters generally begin at the end of August, the week before Labor Day and end in mid-December. Spring semesters begin in mid-January and end in the beginning of May.
See the [full academic calendar](http://www.temple.edu/registrar/documents/calendars/17-18.asp).

**Q: What are the requirements for international students?**
International students who have not earned a bachelor’s or graduate degree from a U.S. institution must take a test of academic English. These scores are required if you were not born on American soil and were educated at an institution outside the United States or if you are a U.S. citizen who earned a degree abroad from an institution where the language of instruction was other than English. No photocopies of score reports for a test of academic English will be accepted from applicants. Scores for the IELTS™, TOEFL® and PTE Academic™ must be reported by the testing service to Temple University within two years of the applicant’s test date. For the minimum acceptable scores on the English language exams and information about other requirements for international applicants, see Temple University’s [Graduate School page](http://www.temple.edu/grad/admissions/international.htm).

**Q:  When should I expect to hear about admission decisions?**
We can make admissions decisions only after we have received completed applications and the application fee has been paid. Applicants should be in contact with the Assistant Director, Jeff Antsen, to make sure that we have received all of the necessary documents. Once the file is complete, the MPP Director reviews the file and makes a recommendation to the College of Liberal Arts, which makes the final decision about admissions. Once the Director makes his recommendation, applicants usually receive an official letter within two weeks from the Graduate School.

**Q: What should I do after I am admitted in order to register for classes?**
After you are admitted, the Assistant Director, Jeff Antsen, will send you a Matriculation Form. Return the form to the College of Liberal Arts admissions office, along with the $200 graduate course deposit (paid online or by check).
Once we receive the deposit, you may register for courses using your password, Temple ID number and username. To ensure you register for the appropriate first semester courses, consult with the MPP program. After consulting with the Director, use your Temple ID, username and password to register through the [TUPortal](https://tuportal.temple.edu/). If you have problems with registration, contact Mr. Antsen or our Coordinator, [Tanya Taylor](mailto:ttaylo01@temple.edu).

**Q: Can I take MPP courses before I apply for admission?**
Yes. Students can take up to 9 credits as “non-matriculated” students. If you decide to apply to the MPP program and are admitted, the credits count towards the degree. Students who are considering taking MPP courses as non-matriculated students should contact the MPP Director before registering for classes.

**Q: Whom should I ask to write my letters of recommendation?**
If you are graduating soon or have recently graduated, your letters should primarily come from professors who taught your courses, or other faculty at your institution with whom you have worked closely. If you have been out of school for a while, then supervisors or colleagues who can speak to your skills and experience would be more appropriate. A mix of different types of references is always desirable.

**Q: Can the 3.0 GPA requirement be waived?**
The 3.0 requirement is University policy and can be waived only under extraordinary circumstances, such as a clear pattern of academic improvement over the course of a rigorous undergraduate training, particularly in upper-level courses.

**Q: Will you accept applications after scheduled deadlines?**
We may only be able to give full consideration to applications that we receive before these the important deadlines.  While we sometimes may be able to accept applications after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee that late applications will be processed and evaluated in time for enrollment in your preferred semester.

**Q: What are the MPP courses like?**
MPP required courses are usually offered in classes of 25 students or less. They provide a mixture of lecture, class discussion, and in some cases, oral reports and presentations.  You should plan on doing significant reading before each course meeting, and most classes require a mix of work both individually and in small groups.

**Q: Can I join this program if I may not be able to attend some seminars?**
We realize that many prospective MPP students work part or full-time and may have many life obligations in addition to pursuing this degree. However, we expect that MPP students make attending all regularly scheduled course meetings a primary weekly priority.

**Q: How many and what kinds of electives are offered?**
We usually offer two electives per semester at our Center City campus. Students who are able to travel to Main campus for courses that start at 5:30 pm, will have a greater number and variety of electives to choose from. The topics covered in each elective vary from semester to semester depending on faculty availability, student interests and our efforts to rotate course offerings.

**Q: How much does the MPP curriculum emphasize statistics?**
Students are required to take only one statistics course (PLCY 8001), which is a standard introductory graduate statistics course. Students who wish to gain additional competency in statistics can take more advanced statistics courses in fulfillment of their elective requirements. Note: Students should take statistics concurrently with or before taking the Policy Analysis course and before the Program Evaluation course.

**Q: What are the specific internship requirements?**
Students must register for PLCY 5085 and serve an internship of approximately 12-15 hours per week, on average, or 168-210 hours per semester/summer. The MPP program is flexible in regards to how many days or hours per week and how many weeks the intern serves in the internship as long as the aggregate number of hours is fulfilled. However, internship sites may require a particular minimum number of hours per week that they need the intern to work.  Internship sites must verify that the intern has served the required number of hours. Interns must submit an internship journal once every two weeks and a paper on the organization in which they serve their internship at the end of the internship. The paper is supervised by the MPP Director or his designee.

**Q: When can I serve my internship?**
As a full-time student, you will usually intern in the summer between the first and second years of the MPP program or in the Fall or Spring semester of your second year.  

**Q: How do I secure an internship?**
Depending on what specific policy issues or type of organizations (eg.executive branch, legislative body, non-profit agency, etc.) you are interested in, the MPP program reaches out to our contacts. Otherwise, you may find an organization that supports the kind of internship you are looking for. 

**Q: Can I be exempted from the internship requirement?**
Students who are employed in public sector, non-profit or for-profit organizations that have direct relevance for public policy or public administration may use their experience in their job as qualifying experience for an MPP internship.  Students may also substitute an internship that they served as an undergraduate student as long as it was substantially similar in content and duration to regular MPP internships.  NOTE: MPP students who are exempted from the normal internship requirement must still register for PLCY 5085, pay for the 3 internship credits, and fulfill the same paper requirement as other MPP students.  These exempt students are, in effect, using their current or past positions as the experiential learning that they draw on to fulfill the written internship requirements.

**Q: How can I serve an internship if I work full-time in a non-public policy related job?**
Students who work full-time in non-policy or public administration-related jobs may face special challenges in fulfilling the internship requirement.  They should work with the MPP Director and their employer to come up with an arrangement that will allow them to fulfill this requirement.

**Q: How do I qualify for in-state tuition?**
To be eligible for in-state tuition, you must have resided in Pennsylvania in the 12 months prior to enrolling in the MPP program.  If you list any out-of-state address on your application, you will be ineligible for in-state tuition.  If ensuring in-state status is an important consideration for you in applying to the MPP program, you should get in contact with [Jeff Antsen](mailto:Jeff.Antsen@temple.edu) to discuss your eligibility for in-state tuition.

**Q: How should I decide which courses to take?**
Before registering for courses each semester, students should contact the MPP Director to discuss which courses they plan to take.  When starting the program, you should focus your schedule on taking required courses before taking electives or serving an internship.  You should take the Statistics course (POLS or PLCY 8001) before or concurrently with the Policy Analysis and before the Program Evaluation courses.

**Q: Who can I talk to if I need help in my courses?**
All of our instructors are personable, helpful folks and are happy to work with students on an individual basis.  If you have general questions about how to register for classes, find academic buildings, or the like, you can also ask [Jeff Antsen](mailto:Jeff.Antsen@temple.edu), the Assistant Director.

**Q: Is the MPP program accredited?**
The MPP Program is not currently accredited, because it is still a young program.  We plan to apply for accreditation with NASPAA (Network of Schools of Public Policy and Administration) when we become eligible in a few years.
