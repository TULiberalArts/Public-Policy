## Temple Faculty and Connections

Members of our faculty bring to their teaching years of real-world experience and expertise as policymakers, agency heads and supervisors, budget and finance managers, senior advisors to governors, mayors, and legislatures, leaders of business and non-profit organizations, and consultants.

Many Temple graduates already hold important posts in state and local government, in nonprofits and consulting firms.  Our alumni include many elected officials, state and local legislators and judges and their staffs, as well as appointed public officials, non-profit leaders, and consultants who work in budgeting and finance, social services, public health, public education, environmental protection, economic development, public safety, and a wide range of other policy fields. They provide important networks through which our graduates will gain entr√©e into exciting and rewarding careers.  This new program is specifically designed to provide education and training for students who seek to follow similar career paths in the future.
