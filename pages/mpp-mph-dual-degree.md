## Master of Public Policy – Master of Public Health (MPP‐MPH) Dual Degree
The MPP‐MPH dual degree program allows individuals to earn both degrees in less amount of time than it would take if they pursued both degrees separately. Students earn both degrees by earning 57 credits rather than the 78 that they would need to earn if they completed each degree separately.

This degree is for individuals who seek to broaden their training beyond the traditional public health curriculum. Federal, state and local governments play a large and growing role in Public Health by issuing regulations, providing critical resources aimed at public education, monitoring and combating epidemics, training the public health workforce, and funding research into public health problems and programs. Given the central role of government in public health, academic MPH programs, including Temple’s, focus partly on political advocacy, policymaking and public administration as they relate to these issues. Adding the MPP to the MPH enhances students’ qualifications for jobs that lie at the intersection of public policy and public health. The MPP incorporates knowledge about how to manage and lead public sector and non‐profit organizations, how to operate in a political environment, ethical dimensions of public policy, along with concrete practical skills and competencies in budgeting, policy analysis, statistics and program evaluation.
The following table shows the requirements for each degree if students pursue them separately. The MPH requires 42 credits and the MPP requires 36 credits, or 78 credits in total.
